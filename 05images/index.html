                The history of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_motion" target="_blank">stop motion</a> can be traced back before the development of celluloid film in 1888. Prior to the rise of chronophotography in 1878, picture sequences captured resembled early forms of stop motion or pixilation, though these were not intended for animation. Mechanisms such as the zoetrope were the limit for animation before celluloid film appeared in 1888. Improvements to the Fantascope in 1849 by Joseph Plateau envisioned a combination of his device and Charles Wheatstone’s stereoscope for enhanced illusion. The stroboscopic disc was patented in 1852 by Jules Duboscq, showcasing stereoscopic photograph pairs capturing motion. In 1855, Johann Nepomuk Czermak experimented with stereoscopic moving images, proposing methods for animating stereoscopic pairs and making suitable stereographic photographs.

            <h2>The Silent Film Era</h2>
            <p>
                Many films were lost in the silent film era from 1895 to 1928. Contemporary documentation such as catalogs and reviews offer some insights into these films, though are often incomplete. The stop trick, closely related to stop motion, involves temporarily stopping the camera during filming to facilitate scene changes. A French trick film pioneer named Georges Méliès claimed to have invented the stop-trick and used it often in his short films. In 1899, Méliès reportedly used stop-motion to create moving letterforms, which showcased an early application of the technique during the silent film era.

            <h2>The Twentieth to Twenty-First Century</h2>
            <p>
                In the 1930’s and 1940’s, innovations like the Pal-Doll techniques, O’brien’s emotive animation in <em>“King Kong”</em>, and the development of promotional stop-motion films showed the surging popularity and versatility of stop-motion. In the 1950’s, innovative approaches to storytelling and a transition from shorts to TV marked a transition into commercial viability for stop-motion animation. In the 1960’s and 1970’s a diversification of styles was seen, as well as an expansion of international impact and commercial and critical success. The 1980’s saw integration with mainstream cinema and further pushed the boundaries of visual style and storytelling. In the 1990’s, stop-motion received greater mainstream recognition and artistic experimentation. The 21st century saw mainstream acceptance and continued success and relevance of the craft. International collaboration continued to grow in this period and to this day.
